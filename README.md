#### Paper: **Chuang Yu**, Yunpeng Liu*, Shuhang Wu, Xin Xia, Zhuhua Hu, Deyan Lan, Xin Liu. Pay Attention to Local Contrast Learning Networks for Infrared Small Target Detection [J]. Accepted by IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters. 2022. ([[paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9785618)])  

### !!! The pytorch version of ALCL-Net can be found in “model_ALCL-Net.py”.

#### We also uploaded the complete dataset [[link](https://github.com/YuChuang1205/SIRST-dataset-MLCL-Net-version)] we used.  

### In addition, everyone is welcome to check out our latest research work: Gradient-Guided Learning Network for Infrared Small Target Detection. (GGL-Net) ([[paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10230271)] [[code](https://github.com/YuChuang1205/Refined-IRSTD-Scheme-with-Single-Point-Supervision/tree/main/model/GGLNet)])   

**1.We have uploaded the final weights, test files and the final detection results to the "sample" folder, and the results correspond to those in the paper.**     

**2.In "sample" folder, "finally_model" folder includes the finally model; "test_ground_truth_label" folder includes the ground truth labels; "test_image" includes the samples that needs to be tested； "test_results" includes the results after the test samples have been tested by the finally model, and the results correspond to those in the paper.**
