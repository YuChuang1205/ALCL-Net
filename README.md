### ALCL-Net code   

#### We also uploaded the complete dataset [[link](https://github.com/YuChuang1205/SIRST-dataset-MLCL-Net-version)] we used.  

**We have uploaded the final weights, test files and the final detection results to the "sample" folder, and the results correspond to those in the paper.**     

**In ""sample" folder, "finally_model" folder includes the finally model; "test_ground_truth_label" folder includes the ground truth labels; "test_image" includes the samples that needs to be testedï¼› "test_results" includes the results after the test samples have been tested by the finally model, and the results correspond to those in the paper.**


**We will describe and supplement the code in more detail later (Been busy recently).**
